##README
Built a system for linking medical cases to information relevant for patient care. Most of the code for query generation and query expansion was written in C++ and assisted through the use of MeSH and MetaMap (a tool for recognizing UMLS concepts). As a post-processing step, 3 separate algorithms for the retrieval-types diagnosis, test and treatment were used to refine and adjust the results that had been retrieved through Indri Retrieval Model.
